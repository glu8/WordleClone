# WordleClone

A basic clone of the word game Wordle built using React. With npm installed, run npm start to run on local dev server. 

Each load of the game will initialize with a random mystery word that the user has six attempts to guess; each guess will provide clues to the number of correct letters it contains after the user commits it by hitting 'Enter'. Once the user guesses the word or exhausts six tries, the game ends and the correct word is displayed. 

Credit to the original Wordle game for the idea.
